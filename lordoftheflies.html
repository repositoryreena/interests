    <strong>Author:</strong> William Golding<br>
    <strong>Published:</strong> 1954<br>
    <strong>Genre:</strong> Dystopian, Allegory, Psychological Drama<br>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong>
    <p>
      *Lord of the Flies* is a novel by William Golding that explores the darker side of human nature. A group of British boys are stranded on a deserted island, and their attempt to govern themselves quickly devolves into chaos and violence. As the boys' societal structure breaks down, their primal instincts emerge, leading to horrific consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The novel is a powerful commentary on the fragility of civilization and the inherent savagery that lies within human beings when social order breaks down. Through characters like Ralph, Piggy, and Jack, Golding explores the conflict between reason and emotion, civility and barbarism.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Lord of the Flies* is often regarded as a classic exploration of human nature, authority, and the consequences of losing the constraints of society. However, it is my least favorite book due to its dark themes and disturbing portrayal of human behavior.

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> *Monos*, the film adaptation, is also my least favorite movie for similar reasons, as it shares a grim and unsettling atmosphere that I found hard to connect with.
