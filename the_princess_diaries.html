    <strong>Character:</strong> Mia Thermopolis<br>
    <strong>Played by:</strong> Anne Hathaway<br>
    <strong>Movie Release Year:</strong> 2001<br>
    <br>
    <p>
      In *The Princess Diaries*, Mia Thermopolis is an awkward teenager who discovers that she is the heir to the throne of a small European country, Genovia. Like Charlie from *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*, Mia is a shy, introverted character who struggles with finding her place in the world. She is awkward in social situations, often feeling out of place and unsure of herself, which makes her a highly relatable character for anyone who has experienced the challenges of adolescence.
      <br><br>
      Mia’s transformation throughout the movie is both physical and emotional. While initially unsure of herself, she gradually becomes more confident in her royal duties and in her personal life. Her journey of self-discovery reminds us that growth comes with time and with facing our insecurities head-on. As she learns to embrace her new identity, she also learns the importance of staying true to who she is.
      <br><br>
      Much like me, Mia navigates the awkwardness of growing up and finding where she belongs. Her story serves as a reminder that it's okay to be unsure, and it's okay to evolve — from an awkward teenager into someone who can embrace both their flaws and their strengths.
