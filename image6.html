            <p>"Wish I could be part of that world."</p>
            <p class="quote-explanation">Ariel's quote in *The Little Mermaid* reflects her longing to be part of the human world, not just because of a desire for freedom, but also because of her love for Prince Eric.

            <p>"It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me or something!"</p>
            <p class="quote-explanation">In *Mean Girls*, Cady says the line "It's not my fault you're, like, in love with me or something!" to Janis, but this is a reflection of Cady's growing sense of superiority and her mistaken belief that everyone around her is infatuated with her. Cady says this to Janis without recognizing that Janis doesn't have romantic feelings for her at all. Instead, it’s more about Cady's increasing self-absorption and misunderstanding of the people around her as she becomes entangled in the social dynamics of high school.</p>
