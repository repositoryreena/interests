        <h2>Pat Solitano: Finding Hope in the Struggle</h2>
        <p>Pat’s journey throughout the film demonstrates how struggling with mental illness can be both a source of pain and a path to greater self-awareness. His efforts to regain control of his life, reconnect with his family, and rebuild his relationships with others show how difficult it can be to move forward. However, as Pat navigates his internal chaos, he gains a deeper understanding of himself, his emotions, and what truly matters in life.</p>
        <p>Pat’s wisdom comes not from having everything figured out, but from his willingness to face his struggles head-on and embrace the vulnerability that comes with asking for help. His growth underscores how we can all find wisdom in our personal battles when we allow ourselves to be open to the people who care about us.</p>

        <h2>Tiffany: Healing Through Connection</h2>
        <p>Tiffany, like Pat, is dealing with personal pain and loss, and her rawness and honesty are both refreshing and painful to witness. Tiffany’s wisdom comes from her ability to take charge of her life and her willingness to be vulnerable with Pat, even when it means confronting her own scars. Their relationship helps Tiffany heal, and in the process, she teaches Pat that it’s okay to acknowledge and work through one’s imperfections.</p>
        <p>Through Tiffany, the film highlights the importance of connection in recovery. Sometimes, healing is not about being perfect, but about sharing your journey with someone who understands your pain. Tiffany's character shows that wisdom often lies in the courage to face emotional truth and connect with others in meaningful ways.</p>
