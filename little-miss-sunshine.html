        <h2>Dwayne: The Silent Wisdom of Frustration</h2>
        <p>Dwayne, the teenager who takes a vow of silence in protest against his family's chaotic nature, embodies the internal conflict and frustration of youth. His emotional journey highlights the importance of breaking free from unrealistic expectations and finding peace, even if it means confronting hard truths.</p>
        <p>His eventual breakdown, where he screams out his frustrations, is a turning point that exposes his vulnerability—and in this, we see his growth, learning that emotional release and acceptance are steps toward wisdom.</p>

        <h2>Frank: Acknowledging Failure and Embracing Life Again</h2>
        <p>Frank, a man who has recently survived a suicide attempt after his failed romantic relationship and career setbacks, represents the wisdom that comes from confronting deep personal loss. His journey in *Little Miss Sunshine* is a testament to the power of resilience and the importance of humor, even in the darkest times. His emotional vulnerability and connection with others, especially his family, provide him with the strength to move forward.</p>
        <p>Through Frank, we see that wisdom doesn't always come from achieving success, but rather from learning how to continue in the face of adversity.</p>
