    <h1>He's Just Not That Into You</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>He's Just Not That Into You</strong> is a romantic comedy that explores the complicated world of relationships and dating. One of the characters, Gigi, played by Ginnifer Goodwin, constantly finds herself in situations where she misinterprets men’s signals, but her journey is about learning the hard truth about love and self-worth. Throughout the movie, Gigi grows and faces difficult realizations about her relationship with herself and others.</p>

        <p>What really resonates with me about Gigi’s character is when she says to Alex, "I’d rather be like that than be like you." In this moment, Gigi acknowledges her vulnerabilities, but also stands up for her belief in love and connection, even if it means accepting the risk of getting hurt. I relate to this line because sometimes I feel like it’s better to be someone who is open to love, even if it makes me vulnerable, than to shut myself off from the possibility of genuine connections, as Alex seems to do.</p>

        <p>There’s something empowering about that moment, as it shows Gigi's strength in embracing who she is, even though she’s been hurt. I, too, would rather take the chance of being emotionally invested and possibly disappointed, than to close myself off to relationships completely. Gigi’s ability to stand her ground and say this, in the face of Alex’s cynical view of love, is a reminder that vulnerability can be a form of strength, not weakness. It's a line I find myself reflecting on when I think about how I approach love and relationships.</p>
