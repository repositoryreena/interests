      <p>“You’re a virgin who can’t drive”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Tai says this line to Cher in a moment of playful teasing. It highlights Cher's lack of real-world experience, especially when it comes to relationships and independence, despite her being an influencer in high school social circles.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Forrest Gump -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/y9gAAOSwUQhi-9Nq/s-l1200.jpg" alt="Forrest Gump">
      <p>“My momma always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'”</p>
      <p class="explanation">This iconic line from Forrest’s mom encapsulates the unpredictable nature of life. It reflects Forrest's perspective on living, suggesting that we can never truly predict the outcomes of our actions or experiences.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lloyd Christmas from Dumb and Dumber -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PNKLA2RbL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="Lloyd Christmas from Dumb and Dumber">
      <p>“That's a lovely accent you have. New Jersey?”<br>“Austria.”<br>“Austria! Well, then. G'day mate! Let's put another shrimp on the barbie!”<br>“Let's not.”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Lloyd’s confusion and lack of cultural understanding makes this exchange hilarious. He assumes the woman’s accent is from New Jersey when it’s actually Austrian, and his stereotypical response adds to his absurdity.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Derek Zoolander from Zoolander -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sfMSvYV5L._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="Derek Zoolander from Zoolander">
      <p>“I'm pretty sure there's a lot more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking. And I plan on finding out what that is.”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Derek’s line humorously reflects his shallow worldview and the comedic contrast between his vanity and his desire to explore life beyond his superficial looks.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Inspector Clouseau from The Pink Panther -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-yshlhd/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/6186/175180/full.thepinkpantherstyleb-22159__00564.1674859822.jpg?c=2" alt="Inspector Clouseau from The Pink Panther">
      <p>“Good one.”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Inspector Clouseau’s humor comes from his failure to understand basic situations while acting like everything is fine. This quote is delivered with irony, as he often misses the most obvious details in his investigations.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Kristen Wiig from Bridesmaids -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NSaiNKO9L.jpg" alt="Kristen Wiig from Bridesmaids">
      <p>“You told me not to bleach my butthole, and I did it anyway, and now I love my new bleached butthole!”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Kristen Wiig’s character Annie makes this absurd and hilarious confession, showcasing her quirky, offbeat sense of humor and her need to prove she’s not just following the rules but doing things her own way.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Steve Carell from Dinner for Schmucks -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS89XJx-ZW4FQxK-AE5KlhJUsPBV54ZtzjuFw&s" alt="Steve Carell from Dinner for Schmucks">
      <p>“In the words of John Lennon, 'you may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not.' ...the only one.”<br>“The only what?”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Steve Carell's character uses a nonsensical twist on the famous John Lennon lyric to demonstrate his oddball way of thinking, while making the situation even more awkward and comically absurd.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Joe from Idiocracy -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pLNnbThwL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt="Joe from Idiocracy">
      <p>“As the twenty-first century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But, as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.”</p>
      <p class="explanation">This quote from *Idiocracy* critiques the idea of societal decline due to an emphasis on quantity over quality in reproduction, satirizing how intelligence and wisdom seem to be less valued in the modern world.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Dory from Finding Nemo -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://myhotposters.com/cdn/shop/products/HP2956_82aee360-c82e-4a7a-999a-e1f0e4e13534_grande.jpg?v=1571445093" alt="Dory from Finding Nemo">
      <p>“How about we play a game?”<br>“All right.”<br>“Okay, I'm thinking of something orange, and it's small...”<br>“It's me.”<br>“Right!”<br>[Later] “I'm thinking of something orange and small...”<br>“Me again.”<br>“All right, Mr. Smartypants...”<br>[Later] “... It's orange and small, and has stripes...”<br>“Me, and the next one - just a guess - me.”<br>“Okay, that's just scary.”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Dory's forgetful nature leads to this funny and endearing back-and-forth, highlighting her optimistic personality and her ability to keep the mood light, even in confusion.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Alice from Alice in Wonderland -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/16952472/r/il/ae1e62/1582515765/il_fullxfull.1582515765_5zfo.jpg" alt="Alice from Alice in Wonderland">
      <p>“It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change.”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Alice’s frustration reflects the chaotic, illogical nature of Wonderland. She longs for clarity in a world that seems to defy all reasoning, making this quote both relatable and absurdly whimsical.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lord of the Rings -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQdsRnR0eH6H3LJPTGSI8gi4CdFsp6xFNSxaw&s" alt="Lord of the Rings">
      <p>“You need people of intelligence on this sort of… thing”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Pippin says this line in *The Lord of the Rings* when he's trying to make sense of the gravity of the situation. The quote highlights his tendency to speak honestly and without thinking, often in moments that require serious reflection. It's a humorous moment that shows Pippin's lack of understanding of the complexities around him, but it also emphasizes the need for thoughtful individuals on important matters, even if it's coming from someone who doesn't always seem to take things seriously.</p>

    <!-- Bugs Life -->
    <div>
      <img src="https://vegalleries.com/sites/default/files/augbugslife19033a.jpg" alt="Bugs Life">
      <p>“They can't know the truth! The truth, you see, is bad! I will be branded with this mistake for the rest of my life! My children's children will walk down the street and people will point and say, 'Look, there goes the spawn of Flik the Loser!'”</p>
      <p class="explanation">Flik’s over-the-top panic reveals his insecurities about failure and his fear of being judged by others, highlighting his growth and determination throughout *A Bug’s Life*.</p>
