    <strong>Director:</strong> Andrew Niccol<br>
    <strong>Released:</strong> 1997<br>
    <strong>Genre:</strong> Science Fiction, Thriller<br>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong>
    <p>
      *Gattaca* is a dystopian science fiction film set in a future where eugenics has become the norm and genetic engineering determines one's social status and career prospects. In this world, individuals are discriminated against based on their genetic makeup, and those born "naturally" without genetic enhancement are considered inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film follows Vincent Freeman, a man born "naturally" (or as they call it, an "in-valid") who dreams of becoming an astronaut, a career that is strictly reserved for genetically superior individuals. Vincent assumes the identity of a genetically engineered man, using deception and a relentless determination to overcome the oppressive system and pursue his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Gattaca* explores themes of genetic determinism, the ethics of eugenics, and the concept of human potential, questioning whether individuals can truly define their own fate, or if they are slaves to their biology.
