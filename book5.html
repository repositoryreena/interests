    <p><strong>Author:</strong> J.D. Salinger</p>
    <p><strong>Published:</strong> 1951</p>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Realistic Fiction, Coming-of-Age</p>
    <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>
    <p>
      In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, one of the books that profoundly influences Charlieâ€™s emotional growth and understanding of the world is The Catcher in the Rye. This novel holds a special place in Charlie's heart, much like it does for many readers who have struggled with feelings of isolation and disillusionment.
<br><br>
The Catcher in the Rye follows the story of Holden Caulfield, a deeply troubled teenager who has just been expelled from his prep school. Narrated by Holden himself, the novel takes readers on a journey through his wandering days in New York City, where he grapples with depression, alienation, and an overwhelming sense of disillusionment with the adult world. Throughout the novel, Holden is cynical and often jaded, but his obsession with protecting the innocence of children reveals his fear of growing up and his desire to shield others from the harsh realities of life.
<br><br>
Charlie, in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, relates strongly to Holden. Both of them are introspective, sensitive, and prone to withdrawing from the world around them as a way of coping with their struggles. Like Holden, Charlie feels like an outsider, someone who doesn't quite fit in. But also like Holden, Charlie's journey is about coming to terms with his own identity and learning to navigate the messy, painful parts of life.
