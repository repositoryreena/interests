    <p>
      *Slaughterhouse-Five* is a satirical novel by Kurt Vonnegut that combines elements of science fiction with an anti-war message. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, becomes "unstuck in time" and experiences different moments of his life, from his time as a soldier during World War II, to his capture by the Germans, to his experiences in a concentration camp, and even his abduction by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. The novelâ€™s nonlinear structure and dark humor highlight the absurdity of war, the inevitability of death, and the futility of human suffering. It is considered one of the most important anti-war novels of the 20th century.
