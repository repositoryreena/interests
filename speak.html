    <strong>Character:</strong> Melinda Sordino<br>
    <strong>Played by:</strong> Kristen Stewart<br>
    <strong>Movie Release Year:</strong> 2004<br>
    <br>
    <p>
      In *Speak*, Kristen Stewart portrays Melinda Sordino, a teenage girl who becomes an outcast after a traumatic event. Her silence becomes both her coping mechanism and her prison as she navigates high school. Much like Charlie in *The Perks of Being a Wallflower* and Nadine in *The Edge of Seventeen*, Melinda is an introverted character who struggles with the weight of her own emotions and the judgment of others. 
      <br><br>
      Melinda’s emotional journey is a deeply personal one. She is haunted by a traumatic event, and her silence stems from her inability to speak about what happened. She becomes isolated from her peers and feels misunderstood, much like the way many shy and introverted individuals feel during their adolescent years. However, throughout the film, Melinda slowly finds her voice, symbolizing the importance of self-expression and healing.
      <br><br>
      Melinda’s character resonates with anyone who has felt the need to hide their true feelings or struggled to find the courage to speak out about personal pain. Like me, Melinda’s journey highlights the power of speaking up, even when it feels impossible.
