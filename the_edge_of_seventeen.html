    <strong>Character:</strong> Nadine Franklin<br>
    <strong>Played by:</strong> Hailee Steinfeld<br>
    <strong>Movie Release Year:</strong> 2016<br>
    <br>
    <p>
      In *The Edge of Seventeen*, Nadine Franklin is a sharp-witted, sarcastic teenager who feels like an outsider. Her world is turned upside down when her best friend Krista starts dating Nadine's older brother, Darian. Nadine struggles with feelings of abandonment, insecurity, and loneliness as she navigates the trials of adolescence. Like Charlie from *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*, Nadine's emotional journey is deeply relatable to anyone who has ever felt lost or misunderstood during the teenage years.
      <br><br>
      Throughout the movie, Nadine's character is witty and cynical, masking her vulnerability and fear of not being good enough. Despite her outward tough exterior, she often feels like she’s on the edge of falling apart, unable to find where she fits in the world. Nadine's journey to self-acceptance, as she deals with her inner turmoil and complex relationships, mirrors the emotional growth many experience during adolescence.
      <br><br>
      Much like me, Nadine is unsure of herself and struggles to connect with others, but over time, she learns to accept her flaws and realizes that her worth doesn't depend on meeting the expectations of others. Her growth throughout the film is both poignant and hilarious, reminding us that it's okay to feel out of place and that sometimes, it takes hitting rock bottom to finally rise above.
