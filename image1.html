    <strong>Author:</strong> Stephen Chbosky<br>
    <strong>Published:</strong> 1999<br>
    <strong>Genre:</strong> Young Adult, Coming-of-age<br>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> 
    <p>
      My dad had me read The Perks of Being a Wallflower because, like Charlie, I’ve always been more of a wallflower. As a shy and introspective person, I tend to observe life from the sidelines rather than jump into the center of attention. Charlie, the book's protagonist, is a high school freshman who, like me, struggles to find his place in the world. Through his letters, Charlie opens up about his thoughts on friendship, love, and the many challenges that come with growing up.
<br><br>
Throughout the novel, Charlie wrestles with both the joy and the pain of life. He makes friends with step-siblings Patrick and Sam, and through these relationships, he begins to discover the complexities of life, as well as the darker parts of his own past. What struck me most about the story is how, even though Charlie is quiet and often feels like an outsider, he still finds a way to connect with others and uncover deeper truths about himself.
<br><br>
One of the things that makes Charlie’s journey so relatable is his love for books. As he navigates the ups and downs of adolescence, he reads and reflects on a series of novels that shape his thoughts and emotional growth. Below, I’ve listed the 12 books Charlie reads throughout The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Each one reflects a different part of his journey and offers a unique perspective on life, love, and the human experience.
